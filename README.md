This project provides a sample skeleton react-native application for iOS that
shows how to configure XCode builds to provide a set of environment variables
to your react-native app at runtime.

Note that this means that you will need to rebuild your app for Debug, Release,
and Staging, however now you will have a way to manage your environment settings
without relying on hard-coded values in your code.

This project was heavily influenced by a blog post from [Multunus](http://www.multunus.com/blog/2016/06/automated-environment-management-react-native-ios/).

The most recent versions of the react-native bootstrapping guide can be found [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).
